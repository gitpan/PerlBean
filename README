PerlBean $Revision: 1.0 $
=============================

QUICK INSTALL/USAGE

1) Install the module as usual
2) Read the tutorial (it's fully reviewd in version 0.6)
3) Run the samples in the tutorial directory

SHORT DESCRIPTION

PerlBean generates well documented bean like Perl module code.

INCENTIVE

I used to spend too much time programming bean like objects in Perl. The coding
of object attributes (properties) sometimes takes more time than the coding of
the object logic, is highly distracts and repetitive work.

JUSTIFICATION

You might argue that code generation (like this package does) is undesired
in OO development and that required additional functionality is to be provided
by classes.

Indeed, I agree. However, although writing a class to abstract this problem is
feasible I highly question its practical usage. Specifically: 1) the class
may actually turn out to be more complex than desired/though 2) the problem
covered may be redefined endlessly 3) additional functional requirements may 
be prohibitive for the user of the class.

Hence, this module generates code which I think is decent/usable and which may
be edited at will.

INSTALLATION
